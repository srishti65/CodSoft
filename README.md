TITANIC SURVIVAL PREDICTION MODEL
This repository contains a machine learning project aimed at predicting the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic. 
The project uses the famous Titanic dataset from Kaggle to train and evaluate various machine learning models.

Introduction
The Titanic survival prediction model uses data about passengers to predict whether they survived or not. 
This project aims to apply various machine learning algorithms, compare their performance, and select the best model for the prediction task.
